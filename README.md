## How to install it

This extension is in the process of being approved for listing on the
Chrome Web Store, so eventually you will be able to download and
install it from there. In the meantime you can add it to Chrome by
hand as follows:

1. Download [the source code][2] and unpack the zip file somewhere on
   your local computer. **NOTE:** You need to leave the unpacked files
   in place as long as you're using the extension, so put the unpacked
   folder somewhere you don't mind it staying for a while.

2. Open chrome://extensions in Chrome or select "Extensions" from the
   "More tools" menu.

3. Click the "Load unpacked" button.

4. Browse to and select the directory containing the extension.

## Provenance

This extension was devised and created entirely by me, with no input
from Senator Brownsberger or anyone on his staff. However, after
creating the extension, I contacted Senator Brownsberger and asked if
it was OK with him for me to share it with others, and he said he did
not object.
