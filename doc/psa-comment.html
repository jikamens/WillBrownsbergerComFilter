<p>Hey, folks. This is a public-service announcement for those of you who, like me, appreciate for the most part the thoughtful discussion that takes place on Senator Brownsberger's web site but find that that some of the regular commenters detract from the experience.</p>

<p>To improve the experience here for myself, I wrote a Google Chrome extension which allows the user to automatically hide all comments from certain people, and optionally the replies to those comments as well. It has occurred to me that others might benefit from this as well, so I have decided to share this extension with the public. (Just to be entirely clear: this will only work for you if you use Google Chrome on the desktop as your browser when reading this site.)</p>

<p>I am in the process of getting the extension published on the Chrome Web Store, but in the meantime, you can install it manually as described <a href="https://github.com/jikamens/WillBrownsbergerComFilter/blob/main/README.md">here</a>. There are also instructions on that page for how to use it once you have installed it.</p>

<p>If you have any questions or run into any issues with the extension, feel free to <a href="mailto:jik@kamens.us">email me</a>.</p>

<p>I hope this improves the experience here for some of you as it has for me.</p>
