    <p>This Chrome extension allows you to filter out commenters by
      name in the replies to articles posted
      on <a href="https://willbrownsberger.com/"
            target="_blank">WillBrownsberger.com</a>.</p>
    <p>To use it, list the names of commenters you don't want to see
      in the text box below, separated by semicolons. If you would
      also prefer not to see the replies to their comments, check the
      checkbox as well. Then save your preferences and reload any
      pages on the site that you're already viewing, and you should
      see your settings take effect.</p>
